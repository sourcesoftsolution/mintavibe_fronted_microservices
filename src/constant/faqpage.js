    question: "What are NFTs?",
    answer:
      "NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital assets stored on a blockchain. These can be compared to a physical collector’s item, which is now digital. This means it is an indivisible, unique crypto asset. As a crypto collectible, its non-fungibility ensures it cannot be mutually exchanged for value. This implies it is not equivalent or similar to another NFT. While it can be bought and sold on an open marketplace, no two NFTs are identical or interchangeable. This makes NFTs distinct from cryptocurrencies. ",

NFTs are also used to tokenize identities and property ownerships, adding to their value..",
