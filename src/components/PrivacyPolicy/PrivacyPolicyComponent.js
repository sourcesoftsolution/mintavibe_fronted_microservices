              3. A Note About Children. We do not intentionally gather Personal
              Data from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under
              13 submits Personal Data to CrossTower and we learn that the
              Personal Data is the information of a child under 13, we will
              attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you
              believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under
              13, please contact us at the address indicated in Section 1 above.

              4. A Note to Users Outside of the United States. If you are a
              non-U.S. user of the Service, by visiting the Service and
              providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your
              Personal Data may be processed for the purposes identified in the
              Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Data may be processed
              in the country in which it was collected and in other countries,
              including the United States, where laws regarding processing of
              Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.
              By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.

              5. Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data” means data that
              allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example,
              your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as
              any other non-public information about you that is associated with
              or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means
              data, including aggregated and de-identified data, that is not
              associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data
              does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual
              persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described
              blow's
            </p>

              <b>5.1. Information You Provide Us.</b>
            </p>

            <div className="push-div">
              <p>
                5.1.1. We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first
                and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, address, and
                CrossTower password when you create an account to log in to our
                network (“Account”).
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1.2. If you use our Services on your mobile device, we may
                collect your phone number and the unique device id number.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1.3. Our Service lets you store preferences like how your
                content is displayed, your location, safe search settings,
                notification settings, and favorite widgets. We may associate
                these choices with your ID, browser or mobile device, and you
                can edit these preferences at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1.4. When connecting to our Services via a service provider
                that uniquely identifies your mobile device, we may receive this
                identification and use it to offer extended services and/or
                functionality.
              </p>

              <p>
                5.1.5. Certain Services, such as two-factor authentication, may
                require our collection of your phone number. We may associate
                that phone number to your mobile device identification
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1.6. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we
                will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other
                content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1.7. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you
                provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and
                version, product registration number, address, and other
                requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding
                support for the Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1.8. We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our
                Service that state that Personal Data is being collected.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2Information Collected via Technology. As you navigate through
                and interact with our Service, we may use automatic data
                collection technologies to collect certain information about
                your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2.1. Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Service
                more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third
                party service provider) collect information from you, including
                your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”)
                address (a number that is automatically assigned to your
                computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session
                to session), domain name, address, wallet type, and/or a
                date/time stamp for your visit.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2.2. Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain
                information automatically and store it in log files. This
                information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet
                service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating
                system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
                information to analyze trends, administer the Service, track
                users’ movements around the Service, gather demographic
                information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor
                our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the
                information may be collected so that when you visit the Service,
                it will recognize you and the information could then be used to
                serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your
                interests.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2.3. Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to
                collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information
                that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are
                viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which
                expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies
                (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide
                you with a more personal and interactive experience on our
                Service. This type of information is collected to make the
                Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us
                to meet your special interests and needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2.4. Pixel Tag. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also
                referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags
                are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in
                function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of
                Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s
                computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web
                pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a
                format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have
                been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are
                of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce
                or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the
                information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2.5. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. We do not
                currently respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms
                that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2.6. Analytics Services. In addition to the tracking
                technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies
                or similar tools when you visit our Service. This includes third
                party analytics services, including but not limited to Google
                Analytics (“Analytics Services”), that we engage to help analyze
                how users use the Service. We may receive reports based on these
                parties’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.
                We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to
                improve our Service. The information generated by the Cookies or
                other technologies about your use of our Service (the “Analytics
                Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The
                Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports
                on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer
                information to third parties where required to do so by law, or
                where such third parties process Analytics Information on their
                behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share
                Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’
                Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Service, you
                consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics
                Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a
                full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at the
                address given in paragraph (1).
              </p>
              <p>
                5.3. Information Collected from Third Party Companies. We may
                receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from companies
                that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or
                private-labeled website or companies that offer their products
                and/or services on our Service. In particular, wallets provide
                us with your address and certain other information you choose to
                share with wallets. These third party companies may supply us
                with Personal Data. We may add this to the information we have
                already collected from you via our Service in order to improve
                it. We do not collect Personal Data automatically, but we may
                tie the information that we collect automatically to Personal
                Data about you that we collect from other sources or that you
                provide to us.
